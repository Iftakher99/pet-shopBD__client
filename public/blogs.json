Laser games provide excellent exercise, helping your cat to burn off energy and stay fit. However, it’s important to use laser pointers responsibly. Since cats can’t catch the dot, they might become frustrated after a while. To avoid this, end the play session by pointing the laser at a toy or treat that your cat can catch. This way, they still feel like they’ve achieved a successful hunt."

Start with short sessions and be patient, rewarding your cat each time they perform the desired action. Over time, your cat will associate the command with the behavior and the reward. This method keeps your cat engaged and strengthens the trust between you, making your bond even stronger."
